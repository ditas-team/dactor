## Review 1: Claude Haiku 4.5

### 1. Strengths

**1.1 Principled Architecture**
The **superset rule** with graceful degradation (§0) is excellently articulated. Rather than fragmenting adapters into incompatible variants, dactor abstracts the common capabilities of 2+ frameworks and documents where each adapter either implements, shims, or returns `NotSupported`. This is pragmatic and scales well as new frameworks are added.

**1.2 Comprehensive Capability Matrix**
The detailed capability tables (§0, §6) provide exceptional clarity on adapter support. Using three explicit strategies (Library Native, Adapter Implemented, Not Supported) prevents ambiguity. The matrix is well-researched and honestly reflects framework limitations (e.g., ractor's lack of bounded mailboxes, coerce's unbounded design).

**1.3 Thoughtful Error Model**
The `ActorError` design (§3.14) is sophisticated and production-ready:
- **Serializable structure** with machine-readable `ErrorCode` (inspired by gRPC, aligns with distributed system best practices)
- **Captures error chains** as strings (respects the fact that `dyn Error` can't cross the wire)
- **Structured details** allow rich context without requiring a custom error type per failure mode
- The three-layer error taxonomy (business error inside `Ok`, runtime error, infrastructure error) is clear and gives callers actionable granularity

**1.4 Message Envelope & Interceptors**
The `Envelope<M>` + `Headers` + `Interceptor` pipeline (§3.1, §3.2) is elegant:
- **Type-keyed headers** (using `TypeId`) eliminate string-based lookups and reduce downcasting
- **Opaque `HeaderValue` trait** allows external crates (like `dcontext`) to plug in tracing/correlation IDs without dactor knowing about them
- **Interceptor traits** with `on_receive`, `on_complete`, `on_stream_item` give three distinct observation points, enabling metrics, logging, and tracing without handler modification

**1.5 Streaming Abstraction**
The `StreamRef<M, R>` design (§3.5) is well-motivated:
- Grounded in real use cases (pagination, subscriptions, progressive results)
- Uses Rust's standard `Stream` trait from `futures-core`, avoiding custom abstractions
- **Backpressure** via bounded `mpsc` channels prevents unbounded memory growth
- **Cancellation semantics** are clean — dropping the stream signals the actor to stop
- The adapter pattern (create channel, wrap receiver, pass sender to handler) is straightforward to implement

**1.6 Mock Cluster Crate (`dactor-mock`)**
This is a standout feature (§3.13):
- **Multi-node in one process** without requiring external infrastructure
- **Forced serialization** catches wire-only bugs in unit tests
- **Rich fault injection API** (partition, latency, jitter, drop, corruption, duplication, reordering, node crashes) enables deterministic chaos testing
- **Per-node `TestClock`** + coordinated `advance_time()` + clock skew provide deterministic time control
- **Inspection API** (`in_flight_count()`, `dropped_count()`, `flush()`) enables assertions on system behavior

**1.7 Actor-Typed References with Compile-Time Reply Safety**
The decision to adopt the Kameo/Coerce pattern (§10.6) is well-justified:
- **`ActorRef<A>` typed to the actor, not the message** — compile-time reply type inference
- **Each message gets its own handler impl** — cleaner than a monolithic pattern-match
- **Messages are reusable** across actors
- **Aligns with 2 of 3 backend libraries** (kameo, coerce)

**1.8 Macro Support Path**
The proc-macro design (§10.7) reduces boilerplate while generating the exact same traits underneath.

**1.9 Lifecycle Hooks on Actor Trait**
Placing lifecycle hooks directly on the `Actor` trait is clean. Default no-op implementations let simple actors ignore them.

**1.10 Dependency Cleanup**
Making `serde` optional (§7) is correct — the core crate shouldn't force a serialization dependency on users who only do local actor communication.

### 2. Concerns

**2.1 Trait Explosion Risk in Adapters**
The design introduces multiple traits: `ActorRef<M>`, `AskRef<M, R>`, `StreamRef<M, R>`, `Interceptor`, `SupervisionStrategy`. Each adapter must implement custom logic for several of these. Risk of subtle incompleteness in one trait's implementation across adapters.

> **Mitigation:** Add comprehensive integration tests in each adapter crate that exercise all traits together.

**2.2 Mock Cluster Codec Abstraction Feels Loose**
The `MessageCodec` trait assumes all cross-node messages use a single codec. Real distributed systems often have codec versioning or per-link codec negotiation. The design doesn't model "serialization failed" as distinct from "message corrupted."

**2.3 ActorContext Lacks Runtime Access**
The `ActorContext` provides `headers` but the design doesn't show how handlers access the runtime for spawning child actors, sending messages, etc. The `// ...` is unspecified.

**2.4 Streaming Cancellation Semantics Could Be More Explicit**
- What happens if the actor continues producing after the channel closes?
- Whether `on_complete` is called with `StreamCancelled` if the actor keeps producing
- Error handling patterns for actors that don't check `tx.send()` return value

> **Suggestion:** Consider whether `StreamSender::send()` should be `#[must_use]`.

**2.5 Interceptor `on_complete` for Streams — Behavior Unclear**
- If the actor sends 100 items and consumer drops, does `items_emitted` report 100 or the last consumed count?
- If the actor crashes mid-stream, is `on_complete` called with `HandlerError`?
- Can the interceptor observe actual items, or only the count?

**2.6 Priority Mailbox Interaction with Backpressure Unclear**
- Does a priority queue with no capacity limit ignore overflow policies?
- How does priority interact with `tell_envelope()`?
- Starvation: can low-priority messages be starved indefinitely?

**2.7 Handler Signature Limits Multi-Message Per Call**
No built-in support for batching or correlating multiple messages (unlike Erlang's `receive after`). Likely fine but worth noting.

**2.8 Error Chain Capture as Strings Loses Structure**
Local `ask()` calls that fail could preserve the full `Box<dyn Error>` chain for better debugging. Consider an `ErrorChainHint` enum for intermediate error types.

**2.9 MailboxConfig as Runtime-Time Decision**
No way to query or modify an actor's mailbox config after spawn. Should there be `get_actor_config` / `update_actor_config` methods?

**2.10 Watch/Unwatch Notifications Aren't Typed**
Does the watcher need a `ChildTerminated` message handler, or is it injected synthetically? The notification delivery mechanism needs clarification.

**2.11 Serialization Assumptions for Remote Calls**
- How do adapters enforce `Serialize + Deserialize` bounds?
- Cross-node delivery protocol not specified
- Type matching across nodes not addressed

**2.12 No Mention of Backpressure in `tell()`**
What happens with many `tell()` to a slow actor with unbounded mailbox? OOM risk.

### 3. Suggestions

1. Define the complete `ActorContext` struct (headers, self_ref, actor_id, runtime access)
2. Clarify interceptor failure semantics for streams — `Reject` should return `Err` immediately
3. Add timeout support to `ask()` and `stream()`
4. Document mailbox config interaction with overflow for priority queues
5. Extend `MessageCodec` with version parameter for testing rolling deployments
6. Add deterministic testing helpers (`assert_message_delivered`, `inspect_mailbox`)
7. Specify interceptor ordering guarantees (registration order, first rejection wins)
8. Consider `RestartWithState` variant in `ErrorAction` for partial recovery
9. Add `StreamGuard` helper type for cancellation safety
10. Add `Serializable` marker trait for cross-node messages (compile-time enforcement)
11. Extend `InterceptContext` with `remote: bool` and `origin_node: Option<NodeId>`
12. Consider making `on_error` fallible (`Result<ErrorAction, ActorError>`)

### 4. Questions

1. How does the adapter distinguish local vs remote actor references?
2. Who assigns the `SupervisionStrategy`? Is there a `SupervisorConfig`?
3. Can interceptors maintain internal state (e.g., rate-limiting counters)?
4. Are messages from the same sender delivered in order? Are handlers sequential or concurrent?
5. How long will deprecated `send()` alias be supported?
6. Should `cluster`, `supervision`, `streaming` be behind optional features?
7. How do timers work with `TestClock` in `MockCluster`?
8. Can actors from different runtimes (ractor + kameo) exchange references?
9. How is message versioning handled for remote calls?
10. Is there a dead letter queue for dropped/overflow messages?

## Review 2: GPT-5.1

### 1. Strengths

- Clear superset principle, with explicit capability matrices.
- Actor/Message/Handler + `ActorRef<A>` API is Rust-idiomatic and type-safe.
- Interceptor + typed Headers design is powerful and non-opinionated.
- Streaming API has good backpressure/cancellation story.
- Error model (`RuntimeError` + `ActorError`) is structured and remote-friendly.
- Mock cluster crate is ambitious but very well thought-through.
- Proc-macro story is ergonomic yet maps to explicit traits.

### 2. Concerns

- **`Actor::on_error` signature is inconsistent:** §3.6 uses `&ActorError`, §10.6 uses `Box<dyn Error>`; this conflicts with the `ActorError`-centric model.
- **Dual ask/stream abstractions** (adapter-level `AskRef`/`StreamRef` vs `ActorRef<A>::ask/stream`) risk divergence or confusion.
- **Superset/`NotSupported` is purely runtime;** no capability discovery or compile-time guarantees, so "works on my backend" surprises are likely.
- **Priority mailbox:** starvation/fairness semantics and interaction with `OverflowStrategy` are underspecified; `DropOldest` exists in the API but is intentionally unimplementable in all adapters.
- **Interceptor `Drop`/`Reject` behavior for `tell`** (silently swallowed) may hide serious failures such as auth or validation.

### 3. Suggestions

- **Normalize `on_error` signature:** use `on_error(&ActorError) -> ErrorAction` everywhere, and make adapter-captured panics always go through `ActorError`.
- **Collapse ask/stream into a single conceptual layer:** keep adapter traits internal and expose only `ActorRef<A>::ask/stream` in the public API to avoid two mental models.
- **Add capability introspection:** e.g., `ActorRuntime::capabilities()` or per-ref flags so libraries can pre-flight requirements instead of discovering `NotSupported` mid-flight.
- **Revisit mailbox API:** either drop `DropOldest` entirely or mark it `#[non_exhaustive]`/experimental; specify fairness guarantees for priority scheduling.
- **Tighten interceptor semantics:** document that `Reject` for `tell` is for non-critical cases only, or provide an opt-in "strict tell" mode that surfaces rejections.
- **For `MessageCodec`:** consider a typed codec boundary (e.g., `Codec<M: Serialize>`) rather than raw `[u8]` ↔ `[u8]`.
- **Ensure proc-macros emit friendly error messages** when methods are generic, return `impl Trait`, or use unsupported patterns.

### 4. Questions

- How will a user reliably know at startup that a chosen runtime supports a required set of capabilities (ask, stream, watch, priority mailbox)?
- What is the story for schema evolution of remote messages (versioning, backwards compatibility) with the default bincode codec?
- Is there a recommended mapping table from each backend's native error types into the shared `ErrorCode` values?
- For remote business errors, is the canonical pattern `Message::Reply = Result<T, ActorError>` (application-level) plus `RuntimeError::Actor(ActorError)` (infrastructure/handler panic), or are other combinations expected?

### Consensus Findings

| # | Finding | Resolution | Detail |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| C1 | `on_error` signature inconsistent between §3.6 and §10.6 | ✅ Fixed | §10.6 `Actor::on_error` now uses `&ActorError` (was `Box<dyn Error>`), matching §3.6. Single source of truth. |
| C2 | `ActorContext` internals are underspecified | ✅ Fixed | `ActorContext` now fully defined: `headers`, `actor_id`, `actor_name`, `send_mode`, plus methods `spawn()`, `send_after()`, `send_interval()` for runtime access. |
| C3 | No capability discovery / introspection API | ✅ Fixed | Added `ActorRuntime::capabilities() -> RuntimeCapabilities` with flags for `ask`, `stream`, `watch`, `bounded_mailbox`, `priority_mailbox`, `interceptors`. Enables pre-flight checks at startup. |
| C4 | `DropOldest` in API but unsupported everywhere | ✅ Fixed | Kept in API but marked `⚠️ Experimental` with doc comment explaining no adapter currently supports it. Added `#[non_exhaustive]` to `OverflowStrategy` for future extensibility. Rationale for keeping: a future adapter (or a custom adapter) may support it, and removing it would be a breaking change to add back. |
| C5 | Timeout support for `ask()` is missing | ✅ Fixed | Added `ActorRef::ask_timeout(msg, Duration)` returning `Err(RuntimeError::Actor(ActorError { code: Timeout }))` on expiry. `ask()` without timeout remains for local calls where timeout is unnecessary. |
| C6 | Interceptor `Reject` for `tell` silently swallowed | ❌ Won't Fix | This is by design. `tell()` is fire-and-forget — the caller has no error channel. Changing this would require `tell()` to return `Result<(), RuntimeError>` which breaks the fire-and-forget contract. The `Reject` disposition exists primarily for `ask()`. The behavior is clearly documented in the `Disposition` enum comments. |
| C7 | Remote serialization protocol/enforcement not specified | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.18 Remote Serialization Contract: `RemoteMessage` marker trait with blanket impl for `Message + Serialize + DeserializeOwned`. Compile-time enforcement on cross-node sends. Schema evolution strategies documented (serde defaults, protobuf, envelope version header). |
| C8 | Priority mailbox starvation/fairness not addressed | ✅ Fixed | Added "Fairness and starvation" section to §3.8 explaining that dactor deliberately does not enforce a fairness policy. Documented recommended patterns (weighted fair queuing, aging, rate limiting) implementable as interceptors or handler logic. |

### Haiku Unique Findings

| # | Finding | Resolution | Detail |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| H1 | Watch/unwatch notification delivery mechanism unspecified | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.15: actors must implement `Handler<ChildTerminated>` to receive watch notifications. `ChildTerminated` is a `Message` with `Reply = ()`. If actor doesn't implement the handler, notifications are silently dropped. |
| H2 | Dead letter queue concept missing | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.16: `DeadLetterHandler` trait with `DeadLetterEvent` and `DeadLetterReason` enum (`ActorStopped`, `MailboxOverflow`, `InterceptorDrop`, `InterceptorReject`, `NetworkFailure`). Built-in handlers: `LoggingDeadLetterHandler` (default), `CountingDeadLetterHandler`, `NullDeadLetterHandler`. |
| H3 | `StreamSender::send()` should be `#[must_use]` | ✅ Fixed | Added `#[must_use = "check if the consumer dropped the stream to stop producing"]` to `StreamSender::send()`. |
| H4 | `InterceptContext` should include `remote: bool` and `origin_node` | ✅ Fixed | Added `remote: bool` and `origin_node: Option<NodeId>` to `InterceptContext`. Enables cluster-aware interceptor policies (e.g., stricter auth for remote messages). |
| H5 | Dynamic mailbox config changes not supported | ❌ Won't Fix | Changing mailbox config at runtime (e.g., switching from unbounded to bounded) is complex and error-prone — it requires draining/migrating in-flight messages. No surveyed framework supports this. If needed, the actor should be restarted with new config via supervision. |
| H6 | Trait explosion risk in adapters | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.19: shared conformance test suite in `dactor::test_support::conformance` that any adapter can run against its `ActorRuntime`. Tests all capabilities including capability-gated tests for optional features. Also added error mapping table per adapter. |
| H7 | Mock cluster codec — single codec for all messages | ❌ Won't Fix | A single configurable codec per link is intentionally simple for a testing crate. Real distributed systems negotiate codecs at the transport layer (adapter-specific). `dactor-mock` is for unit/integration testing, not production networking. Per-message-type codec adds complexity without testing value. |
| H8 | Stream cancellation semantics could be more explicit | ✅ Fixed (partially) | `#[must_use]` on `StreamSender::send()` addresses the safety concern. `items_emitted` in `StreamCancelled` counts items successfully sent to the channel (not consumed by the caller). Explicit docs on "actor continues producing after close" behavior: `send()` returns `Err(ConsumerDropped)`, the actor should break — if it doesn't, subsequent sends keep failing harmlessly (no panic, no block). |
| H9 | Error chain as strings loses structure | ❌ Won't Fix | By design. The error chain must cross process boundaries where Rust error types don't exist. Strings are the only universally serializable representation. For local calls, the original `ActorError` is returned directly (no serialization), so structured matching on `ErrorCode` + `details` is available. Adding `ErrorChainHint` would create a parallel type system that's hard to keep in sync. |
| H10 | Handler limits: no multi-message batching | ✅ Documented | Added §3.17 Message Ordering Guarantees which clarifies single-message-per-handler is by design (all 6 frameworks do this). Batching is application-level: accumulate in actor state, trigger on timer/threshold. Not a framework concern. |
| H11 | Message ordering guarantees not specified | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.17 with 6 explicit ordering rules: same-sender FIFO, no cross-sender guarantee, priority ordering, timer injection semantics, sequential handler execution, no cross-node ordering. |

### GPT Unique Findings

| # | Finding | Resolution | Detail |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| G1 | Dual `AskRef`/`StreamRef` vs `ActorRef<A>::ask()` — two mental models | ✅ Fixed (by §10.6) | The §10.6 decision resolved this: the public API is `ActorRef<A>::ask()` and `ActorRef<A>::stream()` directly. The old `AskRef`/`StreamRef` traits from §3.4/§3.5 are internal adapter implementation details, not user-facing. The consumer sees one `ActorRef<A>` with all methods. |
| G2 | Typed codec boundary (`Codec<M: Serialize>`) better than raw bytes | ✅ Documented | §3.18 explains the design choice: raw `[u8]` matches real network layers and keeps `LinkConfig` simple. The `RemoteMessage` blanket impl provides compile-time safety at the send site. The codec layer is intentionally transport-level (bytes in, bytes out). |
| G3 | Need mapping table from backend errors to `ErrorCode` | ✅ Fixed | Added error mapping table in §3.19 showing how each adapter maps ractor/kameo/coerce errors to `ErrorCode` variants (Internal, ActorNotFound, Unavailable, Timeout, ResourceExhausted, etc.). |
| G4 | `#[non_exhaustive]` on `OverflowStrategy` / `ErrorCode` | ✅ Fixed | Added `#[non_exhaustive]` to both `OverflowStrategy` and `ErrorCode` enums. This allows adding variants in future minor versions without breaking downstream matches. |
| G5 | `on_error` inconsistency | ✅ Fixed | Same as C1 — normalized to `&ActorError`. |
| G6 | Capability discovery | ✅ Fixed | Same as C3 — added `RuntimeCapabilities`. |
| G7 | Schema evolution / message versioning | ✅ Fixed | Added schema evolution strategy table in §3.18 covering `#[serde(default)]`, `#[serde(rename)]`, `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, protobuf, and envelope version headers. dactor doesn't prescribe a strategy but documents recommended approaches. |
| G8 | Proc-macro error messages | ✅ Fixed | Added §3.20 with a table of unsupported patterns and their expected compile error messages. Includes diagnostic quality goals: exact span pointing, actionable suggestions, no leaked trait-bound errors. |

### Summary

| Category | Count |

| ✅ Fixed / Documented in design doc | 22 |
| ❌ Won't Fix (by design) | 4 |
